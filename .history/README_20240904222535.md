# Arduino Radar System

This project, **Arduino Radar System**, is a simple yet effective radar implementation built using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The radar system is designed to detect objects in its surroundings by measuring the distance of objects and visualizing the data in a radar-like display. The project showcases how ultrasonic sensors can be used for distance measurement and object detection in real time.

## Project Overview

The **Arduino Radar System** is developed to simulate a radar that can detect and display the position of objects within its range. By using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a rotating servo motor, the radar system scans its environment, measures the distance to objects, and visualizes the data as a radar sweep.

### Key Features:
- **Object Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of objects within its range.
- **Rotating Mechanism**: A servo motor rotates the sensor to sweep across the environment, simulating a radar scan.
- **Data Visualization**: The detected distances are visualized on a radar-like display using a simple interface.
- **Arduino-based**: The system is controlled using an Arduino board, ensuring easy implementation and programming.

### Components:
- **Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller used to control the radar system.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures the distance to objects by emitting sound waves and calculating the time taken for the echo to return.
- **Servo Motor**: Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to cover a 180-degree area.
- **Processing (Optional)**: Used for visualizing the radar data on a computer display.

### How It Works:
1. The ultrasonic sensor, mounted on the servo motor, emits sound waves and calculates the distance based on the time taken for the waves to return after hitting an object.
2. As the servo motor rotates, the sensor measures distances at different angles.
3. The data is processed and either displayed on an LCD screen or transmitted to a computer for visualization in a radar-style sweep.

### Installation and Setup:
1. Set up the Arduino environment by installing the Arduino IDE: [Arduino IDE installation guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect the components:
   - Ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino pins for distance measurement.
   - Servo motor to rotate the sensor.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.
4. (Optional) Use **Processing** or another graphical tool to visualize the radar data on your computer.

### Future Enhancements:
- Increased scanning range by using more advanced sensors.
- Integration with a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) for better visualization.
- Additional features like object tracking or multi-sensor arrays for higher accuracy.
